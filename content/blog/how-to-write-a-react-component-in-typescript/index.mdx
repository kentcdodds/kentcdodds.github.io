Here's our component without types:

```tsx
const operations = {
  '+': (left, right) => left + right,
  '-': (left, right) => left - right,
  '*': (left, right) => left * right,
  '/': (left, right) => left / right,
}

function Calculator({left, operator, right}) {
  const result = operations[operator](left, right)
  return (
    <div>
      <code>
        {left} {operator} {right} = <output>{result}</output>
      </code>
    </div>
  )
}

const examples = (
  <>
    <Calculator left={1} operator="+" right={2} />
    <Calculator left={1} operator="-" right={2} />
    <Calculator left={1} operator="*" right={2} />
    <Calculator left={1} operator="/" right={2} />
  </>
)
```

Right there you may notice we do things a little differently. Maybe you prefer
this instead:

```tsx
const Calculator = ({left, operator, right}) => (
  <div>
    <code>
      {left} {operator} {right} ={' '}
      <output>{operations[operator](left, right)}</output>
    </code>
  </div>
)
```

I don't like the implicit return there. It means you can't reasonably declare
variables or use hooks. So even for simple components, I never go with this
approach.

Ok, so maybe you do this:

```tsx
const Calculator = ({left, operator, right}) => {
  const result = operations[operator](left, right)
  return (
    <div>
      <code>
        {left} {operator} {right} = <output>{result}</output>
      </code>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Honestly, that's fine most of the time. I personally like the hoisting
characteristics of function declarations rather than function expressions like
that ([learn more](/blog/function-forms)).

Alright, let's add some types to this. For functions, you need to consider the
types coming in and the types going out. Let's start with the input: props. To
start, let's go with a simple type for the props (we'll improve it later):

```tsx
type CalculatorProps = {
  left: number
  operator: string
  right: number
}
```

With that, let's try some options for applying that type to the props object in
our React Component.

A common method to typing a React component is to use one of the generics that
are built-into `@types/react` (I mean, it's built-in right? So what could go
wrong?). Interestingly, you cannot type a function declaration this way, so
we'll have to use a function expression:

```tsx
const Calculator: React.FC<CalculatorProps> = ({left, right, operator}) => {
  // implementation clipped for brevity
}
```

This works pretty well, but there are three major problems with this:

1. Our `Calculator` function now accepts a `children` prop, even though we don't
   do anything with it ðŸ™ƒ (So, this compiles:
   `<Calculator left={1} operator="+" right={2}>What?</Calculator>`).
2. You can't use generics. Not super common, but definitely a downside.
3. We have to use a function expression and can't use a function declaration.

Ok ok, so maybe #3 isn't a _major_ problem, but #1 is pretty significant. There
are a few other smaller issues laid out in
[this excellent GitHub issue](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/8177)
if you want to dive deeper (also check
[the React TypeScript Cheatsheet](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react#function-components)).
Suffice it to say, don't use `React.FC` (or its longer alias
`React.FunctionComponent`).

One of the things I love about React components is that they aren't all that
special. Here's the definition of a React component:

> A React component is a function that returns something React can render.

Now, according to `@types/react`, we're limited to `null` and `JSX.Element`s,
but React can actually render strings, numbers, and booleans as well. In any
case, because a React component is simply a function that returns something
React can render, typing it can be just as straightforward as typing functions.
You don't have to do anything special just because it's React.

So here's how I'd type the props for this component:

```tsx
function Calculator({left, operator, right}: CalculatorProps) {
  // implementation clipped for brevity
}
```

This doesn't have any of the shortcomings of `React.FC` and it's no more
complicated than typing the arguments to a regular function.

Ok, so what about the return value? Well, we could type it as
`React.ReactElement` or even wider as a `JSX.Element`. But honestly, I side with
my friend [Nick McCurdy](https://twitter.com/nickemccurdy) when
[he says](https://twitter.com/nickemccurdy/status/1365384372908621833) that
mistakes can easily be made causing the return type to be too wide. So even
outside a react context, I default to not specifying the return type (rely on
inference) unless necessary. And that's the case here.

## Improving the `CalculatorProps` type

Ok, now this next bit has nothing to do with typing React components, but I
thought you'd find it interesting anyway, so skip ahead if you don't. Let's
improve the `CalculatorProps` type. As a reminder, here's what we have so far:

```tsx
// I took the liberty of typing each of these functions as well:
const operations = {
  '+': (left: number, right: number): number => left + right,
  '-': (left: number, right: number): number => left - right,
  '*': (left: number, right: number): number => left * right,
  '/': (left: number, right: number): number => left / right,
}

type CalculatorProps = {
  left: number
  operator: string
  right: number
}
function Calculator({left, operator, right}: CalculatorProps) {
  const result = operations[operator](left, right)
  return (
    <div>
      <code>
        {left} {operator} {right} = <output>{result}</output>
      </code>
    </div>
  )
}
```

I think the `left` and `right` types are fine. It's the `operator` that I'm
unhappy with. Using `string` is too wide. There are specific operations that are
allowed. For example, what would happen if we tried:

```tsx
const element = <Calculator left={1} operator="wut" right={2} />
```

That right there is what we call a runtime exception my friends. That is...
unless you have `strict` mode on, in which case you'd have a compilation error
on `operations[operator]`. In strict mode, TypeScript will correctly know that
accessing any string from the `operations` object will not _necessarily_ return
a callable function.

There are plenty of ways to solve this problem. Basically, we want to limit the
`operator` to only the supported operators. We can do that with a simple union
type:

```tsx
type CalculatorProps = {
  left: number
  operator: '+' | '-' | '*' | '/'
  right: number
}
```

But if we decided to add the
[Exponentiation Operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Exponentiation)
(`**`), then we'd have to update not only the `operators` object, but also the
`operator` type which would be annoying. Maybe there's a way we can derive the
type for the `operator` based on the `operators` object? Why, yes there is!

```tsx
type CalculatorProps = {
  left: number
  operator: keyof typeof operations
  right: number
}
```

`typeof operations` is going to get us a type that describes the `operations`
object, which is roughly equal to:

```tsx
type OperationsObj = {
  '+': (left: number, right: number) => number
  '-': (left: number, right: number) => number
  '*': (left: number, right: number) => number
  '/': (left: number, right: number) => number
}
```

The `keyof` part will take all the keys of that type, resulting in
`'+' | '-' | '*' | '/'` ðŸŽ‰

But I'm not done... I'm not a fan of having to type each of the `operations`
objects. They're identically typed (by necessity due to the use case). The
`operations` object is really just a record of operation strings mapped to a
function that operates on two numbers. If we were to extract the type for those
functions into a single type, it would be:

```tsx
type OperationFn = (left: number, right: number) => number
```

So if we add a type annotation on our `operations` variable, then we don't have
to type each function individually. Let's try that:

```tsx
type OperationFn = (left: number, right: number) => number
const operations: Record<string, OperationFn> = {
  '+': (left, right) => left + right,
  '-': (left, right) => left - right,
  '*': (left, right) => left * right,
  '/': (left, right) => left / right,
}

type CalculatorProps = {
  left: number
  operator: keyof typeof operations
  right: number
}
```

Sweet, so we don't have to type every function individually, but oh no... now
the `typeof operations` is `Record<string, OperationFn>` and the `keyof` of that
is going to be `string` which means our `CalculatorProps['operator']` type will
be `string`. Ugh ðŸ˜©

Here's what we could do to fix this:

```tsx {2-3}
type OperationFn = (left: number, right: number) => number
type Operator = '+' | '-' | '/' | '*'
const operations: Record<Operator, OperationFn> = {
  '+': (left, right) => left + right,
  '-': (left, right) => left - right,
  '*': (left, right) => left * right,
  '/': (left, right) => left / right,
}

type CalculatorProps = {
  left: number
  operator: keyof typeof operations
  right: number
}
```

But now we're back to having to add `**` in two places if we decide to add the
Exponentiation operator. However, in this case, TypeScript will give us a
compiler error if we add it in one and not the other, so that's a step up.

At this point, we just need to decide which we dislike the least: If we type
every function individually, we deal with repetition in every function. If we
add a type annotation to the object, we have duplication between the property
names and the operators. Neither of these is more error prone, so it's really
just preference at this point. If I were reviewing a PR from you, I wouldn't
have an issue if you went with either approach.

Personally, I think I prefer the `type Operator` option because I just don't
like repeating the types in the functions.

## Conclusion

Here's the finished version:

```tsx
type OperationFn = (left: number, right: number) => number
type Operator = '+' | '-' | '/' | '*'
const operations: Record<Operator, OperationFn> = {
  '+': (left, right) => left + right,
  '-': (left, right) => left - right,
  '*': (left, right) => left * right,
  '/': (left, right) => left / right,
}

type CalculatorProps = {
  left: number
  operator: keyof typeof operations
  right: number
}

function Calculator({left, operator, right}: CalculatorProps) {
  const result = operations[operator](left, right)
  return (
    <div>
      <code>
        {left} {operator} {right} = <output>{result}</output>
      </code>
    </div>
  )
}

const examples = (
  <>
    <Calculator left={1} operator="+" right={2} />
    <Calculator left={1} operator="-" right={2} />
    <Calculator left={1} operator="*" right={2} />
    <Calculator left={1} operator="/" right={2} />
  </>
)
```

I hope that gives you an idea of a good way to type your React components. Good
luck and take care!
