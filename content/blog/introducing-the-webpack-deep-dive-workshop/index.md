This is an exciting announcement!
[Let your friends know!](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=There%27s%20a%20new%20webpack%20workshop%20on%20@FrontendMasters%20from%20@kentcdodds!%20Check%20it%20out!%20kcd.im/fem-webpack%20%F0%9F%8E%8A)

Here's a preview:

I've spent countless hours working with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). I
remember the first time I tried it out way back around December of 2014. I had
built a reeeeally complicated gulp process (you can see some of that
[here](https://medium.com/@kentcdodds/angularjs-script-loading-108652bde20e))
and decided that I wanted to simplify things. I had heard about webpack and
decided to give it a try.

After two weeks of refactoring and being totally lost, I finally got it working.
Over the course of the next few weeks I would find myself telling people:

> _It's not a matter of whether webpack can do something you need it to for your
> app, it's a matter of_ **_how_** _to configure it to do that for you_

And the configuration was not entirely straightforward. Also, because it's such
a hugely powerful tool, built mostly by one person (who knows English as a
second language), the docs were often sparse and confusing. So I spent a great
deal of time learning how to use this tool to effectively build my applications.
And I was hooked by the amazing things it could enable me to do. Webpack is an
enabling technology. And as someone who gets really enthusiastic about tech I
find interesting and helpful, I wanted to share my new-found interest with
others. As an [egghead.io instructor](http://kcd.im/egghead), I have a platform
to do that!

Since then, I've made dozens of webpack related videos
[on egghead](http://kcd.im/egghead-webpack). And I have several webpack related
videos on [my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/kentcdodds) as well. _Real_
people are getting _real_ value out of my content. That's pretty rewarding to
me!

That's why I'm so excited to have my Frontend Masters workshop released and made
available to you all. **It's the most comprehensive webpack material available**
(AFAIK).
[Let me know what you think](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Thanks%20for%20the%20@FrontendMasters%20Webpack%20Deep%20Dive%20workshop%20@kentcdodds!%20It%20was%20awesome!%20kcd.im/fem-webpack%20%F0%9F%8E%89)!
If you're not already a subscriber, I seriously recommend you give
[subscribing to Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/enroll/) some
solid consideration. There's a ton of fantastic content on there! So much
learning to be had!

Here's the little marketing spiel about the course:

> _"Why have I spent so much time on mastering Webpack? I've tried script tags,
> require.js, grunt, gulp, and shell scripts. When I finally looked into
> Webpack, so many problem categories went away. Not just in my build process,
> but in my entire architecture of my applications. Unfortunately, Webpack is a
> bit of a beast to learn. I've spent hours upon hours learning and using
> Webpack. I'm so excited to share my experiences with you." ~Kent C. Dodds_
