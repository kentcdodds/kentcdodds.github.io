_The simple rules for when to use each..._

All three of these can be used to do basically the same thing, but some are more
optimal than others. So here are some rules for you to consider when deciding
which of these [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/hooks) to use.

### [useEffect](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect)

99% of the time this is what you want to use. When hooks are stable and if you
refactor any of your class components to use hooks, you'll likely move any code
from `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` to
`useEffect`.

**The one catch** is that this runs _after_ react renders your component and
ensures that your effect callback does not block browser painting. This differs
from the behavior in class components where `componentDidMount` and
`componentDidUpdate`run synchronously after rendering. It's more performant this
way and most of the time this is what you want.

However, if your effect is mutating the DOM (via a DOM node ref) **_and_** the
DOM mutation will change the appearance of the DOM node between the time that it
is rendered and your effect mutates it, then you **don't** want to use
`useEffect`. You'll want to use `useLayoutEffect`. Otherwise the user could see
a flicker when your DOM mutations take effect. **This is pretty much the only
time you want to avoid** `**useEffect**` **and use the other two hooks
instead.**

So what's the difference between the other two?

### [useLayoutEffect](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#uselayouteffect)

This runs synchronously immediately after React has performed all DOM mutations.
This can be useful if you need to make DOM measurements (like getting the scroll
position or other styles for an element) and then make DOM mutations **or**
trigger a synchronous re-render by updating state.

### Summary

- **useLayoutEffect:** If you need to mutate the DOM and/or DO need to perform
  measurements
- **useEffect:** If you don't need to interact with the DOM at all or your DOM
  changes are unobservable (seriously, most of the time you should use this).

### Conclusion

[I am extremely excited about React's upcoming hooks feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jlTw2XI7I8&t=39s&list=PLV5CVI1eNcJgCrPH_e6d57KRUTiDZgs0u).
I think it's going to make React much easier to learn and use.
