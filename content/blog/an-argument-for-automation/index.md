We all have workflows we go through regularly to get our job done. When we start
working we need to open a few applications, websites, and start a few servers.
When we commit code we follow a convention for our message. When we create a new
React component, Angular directive, or unit test file, we structure it the same
way as always.

You could take time to automate all of this stuff, but is it really worth it? I
mean, how long does it take to open a few apps, copy/paste some skeleton code,
etc.? Let's say it takes two hours to automate creating all the files I need for
an Angular directive (tests, js, css, template) — a task that takes about 30
seconds. I'd have to do that 240 times to make it worth it, right?

If you're just doing the math like that, you might think, "yeah, it's probably
not worth it." _(Though to be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if I've done that
particular task 2,400 times!)_ But...
