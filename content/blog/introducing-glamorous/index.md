I was building something for my product at PayPal (blog post maybe forthcoming)
and got tired of writing components like this:

```jsx
const styles = glamor.css({
  fontSize: 20,
  textAlign: 'center',
})
function MyStyledDiv({className = '', ...rest}) {
  return <div className={`${styles} ${className}`} {...rest} />
}
```

So I decided to try out
[styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
because the hype-train was strong ðŸš‚. I REALLY liked it:

https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/840329548885557250

It allowed me to write that same component like this:

```js
const MyStyledDiv = styled.div`
  font-size: 20px;
  text-align: center;
`
```

> Making composable components that carry their styling with them was just
> superÂ awesome.

Unfortunately, I hit a wall when I realized that there isn't currently a
solution for right-to-left conversion (like
[CSSJanus](https://github.com/cssjanus/cssjanus) or
[rtl-css-js](https://github.com/kentcdodds/rtl-css-js)) and that's a hard
requirement for what I'm building. I also had some issues with the size of
styled-components at the time (note that you can transpile away a lot of the
size if you're willing to give up
[_some_ dynamic capabilities](https://github.com/kentcdodds/glamorous/issues/4),
which I was unwilling to do).

So after evaluating a bunch of other solutions and trying to enhance existing
solutions to be what I wanted them to be, I decided to create my own.

### Enter [glamorous](https://github.com/paypal/glamorous) ðŸ’„!

[**paypal/glamorous**  
\_glamorous - React component styling solved ðŸ’„_github.com](https://github.com/paypal/glamorous 'https://github.com/paypal/glamorous')[](https://github.com/paypal/glamorous)

`glamorous` is React component styling solved with an elegant
([inspired](https://github.com/kentcdodds/glamorous#inspiration)) API, small
footprint (<5kb gzipped), and great performance (via
[`glamor`](https://github.com/threepointone/glamor)). It has a very similar API
to styled-components and uses similar tools under the hood
([glamor](https://github.com/threepointone/glamor)). The benefits being:

Let's get a quick look at what a glamorous component looks like:

````js
// Create a <Title> react component that renders an <h1> which is
// centered, palevioletred and sized at 1.5em
const Title = glamorous.h1({
  fontSize: '1.5em',
  textAlign: 'center',
  color: 'palevioletred',
})
```js
// Create a <Wrapper> react component that renders a <section> with
// some padding and a papayawhip background
const Wrapper = glamorous.section({
  padding: '4em',
  background: 'papayawhip',
})
```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <Wrapper>
      <Title>
        Hello World, this is my first glamorous component!
      </Title>
    </Wrapper>
  )
}
````

_(thanks to styled-components for the example inspiration)._

The beauty of glamorous is that all of the cool things you can do with
[glamor](https://github.com/threepointone/glamor), you can do with glamorous.
Here are a few examples:

[**pseudoclasses**](https://github.com/threepointone/glamor/blob/5e7d988211330b8e2fca5bb8da78e35051444efd/docs/howto.md#pseudoclasses)

```js
const MyLink = glamorous.a({
  ':hover': {
    color: 'red',
  },
})
```

[**child-selectors**](https://github.com/threepointone/glamor/blob/5e7d988211330b8e2fca5bb8da78e35051444efd/docs/howto.md#child-selectors)
(the escape hatch you should rarely use, but is nice to have)

````js
const MyDiv = glamorous.div({
  display: 'block',
  '& .bold': { fontWeight: 'bold' },
  '& .one': { color: 'blue' },
  ':hover .two': { color: 'red' }
})
```jsx
<MyDiv>
  <div className="one bold">is blue-bold!</div>
  <div className="two">hover red!</div>
</MyDiv>
````

[**media queries**](https://github.com/threepointone/glamor/blob/5e7d988211330b8e2fca5bb8da78e35051444efd/docs/howto.md#media-queries)

```js
const MyResponsiveDiv = glamorous.div({
  width: '100%',
  padding: 20,
  '[@media](http://twitter.com/media "Twitter profile for @media")(min-width: 400px)': {
    width: '85%',
    padding: 0,
  },
})
```

[**animations**](https://github.com/threepointone/glamor/blob/5e7d988211330b8e2fca5bb8da78e35051444efd/docs/howto.md#animations)

````js
import {css} from 'glamor' // or require or whatever...
```js
const bounce = css.keyframes({
  '0%': { transform: 'scale(1)', opacity: 0.3 },
  '55%': { transform: 'scale(1.2)', opacity: 1 },
  '100%': { transform: 'scale(1)', opacity: 0.3 }
})
```js
const MyBouncyDiv = glamorous.div({
  animation: `${bounce} 1s infinite`,
  width: 50,
  height: 50,
  backgroundColor: 'red',
})
````

**theming**

With the new `ThemeProvider` (recently added by
[Alessandro Arnodo](https://medium.com/u/4f41b6fff014)), glamorous also supports
theming:

```
const Title = glamorous.h1({
  fontSize: '10px'
}, (props, theme) => ({
  color: theme.main.color
}))

// use <ThemeProvider> to pass theme down the tree
<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
  <Title>Hello!</Title>
</ThemeProvider>

// it is possible to nest themes
// inner themes will be merged with outers
<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
  <div>
    <Title>Hello!</Title>
    <ThemeProvider theme={secondaryTheme}>
      {/\* this will be blue */}
      <Title>Hello from here!</Title>
    </ThemeProvider>
  </div>
</ThemeProvider>
```

And if you need global styles, you can just
[use glamor](https://github.com/threepointone/glamor/blob/5e7d988211330b8e2fca5bb8da78e35051444efd/docs/howto.md#global-css-rule)
to do that (you can do this with styled-components as well). And there many
other cool things you can do with glamor (including
[Server Side Rendering](https://github.com/kentcdodds/glamorous#server-side-rendering-ssr))!

Another great feature of `glamorous` is it will merge glamor class names
together automatically for you. Learn more about that
[here](https://github.com/kentcdodds/glamorous/blob/2c5cba47ed83a744b8dec1ac8f85b560eae818b7/README.md#classname).
